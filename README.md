# FilmQueryProject

# Description:
The FilmQueryProject is a Java application that enables users to interact with a database of films, actors, and languages. Users can look up films by their ID, search for films using keywords, and find information about actors and the languages in which films are available.

# Technologies Used:
- Java
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL
- SQL
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

# Lessons Learned:
- Database Connectivity: I acquired skills in connecting Java applications to a MySQL database using JDBC. This involved handling connections, executing SQL queries, and managing result sets.

- Object-Oriented Programming: The project reinforced object-oriented programming principles. I created classes like Film, Actor, and Language to model entities and their relationships.

- SQL Queries: I learned to create and execute SQL queries for retrieving specific data from the database, such as finding films by ID, searching for films by keywords, and obtaining actors associated with a particular film.

- Exception Handling: The project emphasized handling exceptions, especially SQLExceptions, which may occur during database interactions. Proper exception handling contributes to effective error management.

- User Interface Design: The application featured a straightforward text-based user interface, enabling users to make choices and interact with the database through intuitive menus. This underscored the importance of user-friendly design.

- Code Organization: I developed skills in organizing code into classes and methods, promoting readability, maintainability, and the separation of concerns.

- Version Control: I learned the importance of effective version control, using systems like Git to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a comprehensive history of the project's development.
